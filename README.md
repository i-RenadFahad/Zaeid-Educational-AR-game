# Zaeid-Educational-AR-game
The project presents an Augmented Reality (AR) game called Zaeid that aims to promote learning math for kids with dyscalculia using Arabic content.  The user interacts with a character throughout the game using a cartoon atmosphere that will evoke the focus of the dyscalculia child in a very joyful environment.
